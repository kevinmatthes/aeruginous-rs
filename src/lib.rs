//!
//! ## Introduction
//!
//! `aeruginous` is a Rust application providing several development utilities.
//!
//! Originally, it was planned to be a time tracking CLI but during the
//! development of the first stable version, certain common tasks needed to be
//! fulfilled repeatedly.  Since the application already had a somehow stable
//! calling interface, the solutions to these tasks were added as subcommands
//! to `aeruginous` in order to provide a convenient and time efficient
//! automation.  One major advantage of doing so is the reduced maintenance
//! effort and overall setup overhead because there is only one project to
//! maintain instead multiple ones.
//!
//! This is how the idea arose to design `aeruginous` to be a toolbox instead
//! of only a time tracker.
//!
//! ## Installation
//!
//! To download the latest stable version from [`crates.io`][crates-io-url], run
//! the following command.
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo install aeruginous
//! ```
//!
//! To install the latest nightly version from sources, Cargo also supports the
//! installation from the current repository state.
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo install --git https://github.com/kevinmatthes/aeruginous-rs
//! ```
//!
//! ## Meaning of the Name
//!
//! When searching a name for this project, one main requirement was to reflect
//! both the originally intended main purpose of tracking time as well as the
//! coding language this CLI is written in, Rust.  The adjective *aeruginous*
//! fulfills both criteria as it means that the described noun has patina, a
//! special form of rust which appears after a certain period of time has
//! passed.
//!
//! ## Supported Subcommands
//!
//! ### `cffreference`
//!
//! > To be called with:
//! >
//! > - `cffref`
//! > - `cffreference`
//! > - `cff-reference`
//!
//! CFF makes software citable.  Projects exposing a `CITATION.cff` can be cited
//! with APA plain text citations, BibTeX database entries, and also in another
//! `CITATION.cff`'s list of references.
//!
//! This subcommand grabs the citation information of the named source CFF file
//! and pastes it at the end of the given output file.
//!
//! If the input file is omitted, the input information are attemted to be read
//! from [`std::io::Stdin`].  Likewise, omitting the output file will cause
//! `cffreference` to write to [`std::io::Stdout`].
//!
//! ### `graph-description`
//!
//! > To be called with:
//! >
//! > - `agd`
//! > - `graph-description`
//!
//! The Aeruginous Graph Description is a very easy to learn coding language to
//! describe the structure of graphs.  The language itself is based on plain
//! English ensuring that no programming skills at all are required to learn it.
//!
//! This mode is not finished, yet, but it can already detect some issues
//! regarding given input files.
//!
//! ### `rs2md`
//!
//! > To be called with:
//! >
//! > - `rs2md`
//!
//! Source code should always be documented.  Rust's documentation system
//! supports Markdown syntax in documentation comments.  Thus, it is a
//! convenient decision to create a Rust project's README file from the crate
//! root's documentation.  This command is also helpful to check the
//! documentation comments for typos.
//!
//! When called, the subcommand accepts a list of input files to read from.  If
//! no input file is given, `rs2md` will read from [`std::io::Stdin`].  At
//! option, an output file can be specified where the results will be written
//! to.  If omitted, the results will be written to [`std::io::Stdout`].
//!
//! Users are free to choose whether they would like to extract Rust comments
//! starting with `//!` (outer comments) or comments starting with `///` (inner
//! comments).  If neither option is given, nothing will be extracted.
//!
//! ### `uncrlf`
//!
//! > To be called with:
//! >
//! > - `uncrlf`
//!
//! Source code should have a uniform appearance.  Some text editors terminate
//! lines by Carriage Return Line Feeds (CRLFs, `\r\n`).  This subcommand will
//! remove those from the given file.
