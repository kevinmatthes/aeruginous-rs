//!
//! ## Introduction
//!
//! `aeruginous` is a Rust application providing several development utilities.
//!
//! Originally, it was planned to be a time tracking CLI but during the
//! development of the first stable version, certain common tasks needed to be
//! fulfilled repeatedly.  Since the application already had a somehow stable
//! calling interface, the solutions to these tasks were added as subcommands
//! to `aeruginous` in order to provide a convenient and time efficient
//! automation.  One major advantage of doing is the reduced maintenance effort
//! and overall setup overhead because there is only one project to maintain
//! instead multiple ones.
//!
//! This is how the idea arose to design `aeruginous` to be toolbox instead of
//! just a time tracker.
//!
//! ## Meaning of the Name
//!
//! When searching a name for this project, one main requirement was to reflect
//! both the originally intended main purpose of tracking time as well as the
//! coding language this CLI is written in, Rust.  The adjective *aeruginous*
//! fulfills both criterions as it means that the described noun has patina, a
//! special form of rust which appears after a certain period of time has
//! passed.
//!
//! ## Supported Subcommands
//!
//! ### `rs2md`
//!
//! Source code should always be documented.  Rust's documentation system
//! supports Markdown syntax in documentation comments.  Thus, it is a
//! convenient decision to create a Rust project's README file from the crate
//! root's documentation.  This command is also helpful to check the
//! documentation comments for typos.
//!
//! When called, the subcommand accepts a list of input files to read from.  If
//! no input file is given, `rs2md` will read from `stdin`.
//!
//! At option, an output file can be specified where the results will be written
//! to.  If omitted, the results will be written to `stdout`.
//!
//! Users are free to choose whether they would like to extract Rust comments
//! starting with `//!` (outer comments) or comments starting with `///` (inner
//! comments).  If neither option is given, nothing will be extracted.
