## Meaning of the Name

When searching a name for this project, one main requirement was to reflect both
the purpose of tracking time as well as the coding language this CLI is written
in, Rust.  The adjective *aeruginous* fulfills both criterions as it means that
the described noun has patina, a special form of rust which appears after a
certain period of time has passed.
